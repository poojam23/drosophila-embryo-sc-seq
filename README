This file contains the input data for this project. It contains the gene expression for ~9000 genes as observed in ~1300 Drosophila Stage 6 embryo cells. This data has been obtained by single cell RNA sequencing [1].

File: cluster_top_genes.csv

There are 11 spatial clusters identified by [1] in the 1300 cells that have sequenced. Each of these clusters has some genes that are differentially expressed in them. This file contains a list of the top 15 differentially expressed genes in each of the clusters. This data comes from [2], which is the project website for [1]. Each cell (described by the 9000-values-long gene-expression vector) in the input data belongs to one of the 11 clusters. The cell names have the ID of the cluster that they belong to appended to their names.

File: linear-regression.ipynb

This python jupyter notebook contains a linear regression pipeline. A brief description of the linear regression pipeline is as follows: first feature selection is performed using Elastic Net, this greatly reduces the number of feature genes from ~8999 down to usually 2-digits. Then using OLS pseudo p-values, another round of feature selection is performed. Then using the remaining features, a linear ridge regression model model is learnt for the target gene.

Since there are too many genes to make sense of, I am focusing on the top genes in all the spatial clusters identified by [1]. These per-cluster top genes were obtained from the project website [2] of [1].

For each of these top genes, I am running the linear regression pipeline using data from all the 1300 cells and then I am also running the same pipeline for this target gene using data from only those clusters where this gene is a top gene. Each time the pipeline is run, some of the data points are held-out for testing using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Then the idea is to compare the results from the 2 runs.

File: dim-reduction-and-clustering.ipynb

Here I have tried to perform dimensionality reduction of the data to visualize the different 11 clusters in 2 dimensions. In one case I am using only t-SNE, which produced very bad results, probably because I tried to reduce ~9000 dimensions directly down to 2 using t-SNE. This approach was not able to separate out the spatial clusters at all in 2 dimensions. In another approach, I reduced the dimensions down first by PCA to about 50 and then reduced those down to 2 finally using t-SNE. This produced a much better result in terms of separating out the 11 spatial clusters in 2 dimensions.

Even in the PCA + t-SNE approach, it seems like there are only about 2 major clusters in the data observing visually in 2-dimensions.
